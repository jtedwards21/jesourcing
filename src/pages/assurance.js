                            <p>All buyers have concerns about their Asian supplierâ€™s ability to achieve goals for quality and lead time. For some products, spot inspections or inspections performed by the supplier may not be enough to fulfill customer requirements. For these reasons, we provide services for 100% inspection.</p>
                            <p>In this scenario, components or goods can be shipped to our warehouse in China where inspection, assembly, packing or other requirements can be taken care of using local labor operating under western management.</p>
                            <p>This sort of consolidation also allows for pre-emptive management of quality control issues before the product is shipped from China. Freight is further consolidated here in order to save on costs. Our facilities and processes are ISO compliant.</p>
