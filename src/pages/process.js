                    <p>Our first step is to organize and translate the requirements that we receive from customers into specifications that suppliers can understand. Our goal here is to do our best to understand better the costs involved in the purchase of the specific components, this makes it easier for cost reduction later. Additionally, this allows us to better negotiate with suppliers at a later stage. Through the assessment of specifications we are also better able to assess what the costs of our services might be for customers at later stages (i.e., Procurement of Samples).</p>

                     <p>Our RFQ is a professional document with specific instructions for suppliers, rather than just an informal request for a price.</p>

                          <p>Payment can be done in a number of ways to suit the quantity and product. Customers can pay directly to the supplier or to our company, Rigor Industrial. Through payment through us, customers have a guarantee of the quality of the products and that the supplier will not send a final product that does not correspond to the order. Should we receive product that does not match what was agreed on, we would then be able force the manufacturer to refund any downpayment that was made prior to manufacturing. If the full amount had already been directly paid to the manufacturer, this would be difficult to guarantee.</p>
